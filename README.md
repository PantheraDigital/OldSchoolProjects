# OldSchoolProjects
Each branch contains a different project I have made while in school for assignments. These are old projects now of mine but demonstrate my skill in code architecture and C++. These are not all of my projects but ones I have chosen to share as they have a skill show or enough functionality to warrant sharing.

I do not intend on editing these projects, at least not here. They are uploaded as they were turned in to my teachers, spelling errors and all.
